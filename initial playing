//more compactly can do ds to get names of variables only

summarize indexdate //or su indexdate, and can ask for detail: su indexdate, d, which gives
//centiles etc, not that this is meaningful for index date

su age, d

//list gives us each case with it's characteristics: 
//immediately there is an error in that one of the cases has code 0 for 
//typediab

list case typediab in 1/5

// can try to find others: 

list id case typediab if typediab==0 & case==1


//There are loads of them!

//try to create a variable for them:

generate mismatch1 = 1 if typediab==0 & case==1 

tab mismatch //there are 847 of them

// this is because each line is an event, not a patient - so they were seen before diagnosis of DM

// graphing index dates seems to show data ranges from 01Jan2000 to approx jan 2011

// things to achieve, then try to do them:

//go through all the variables:]

//how many lines in the dataset?

//id: how many id's? 

//Case: how many entries are cases vs controls?  how many patents are cases vs controls?

//indexdate: what is the range of dates?

//Eventdate: what is the range of dates?

//consultgroups 1-4, how many of each?

//medcode 1-8: how many of each?

//symptom 1-8: as above, are they the same (truthing)

//Age at index date: what is the age range of: events, cases, controls (truthing, should be the same).  Graph these (histogram).

//sex: what is the sex distribution of: events, cases and controls: should be same

//died: how many? when? should be none

//birthdate: range?

//regdate: range?  Should be 15 months before indexdate: check this.  

// xferdate: how many?  when?

//deathdate: see death

//case_patid: matching ID

//typediab: make sure all cases have this and no controls do.
