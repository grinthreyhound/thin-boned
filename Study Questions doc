Study questions: 

1. Do children with Diabetes Mellitus present more frequently than their controls before they are diagnosed with DM?

2. If so - when do they start to present more frequently? (in relation to the time of their diagnosis)

3. Hypothesis generating/descriptive: How do they present i.e. what modes of presentation and what codes are recorded?

4. Hypothesis Testing: Is there evidence that they present with classic symptoms (Polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, nocturia, enuresis...et al) prior to diagnosis?  When do these codes become more prevalent in these childrenâ€™s records than controls?

5. Supplementary question: What proportion of children with DM are referred by their GP, and of those who were not, did they have codes for consultations +/- symptoms recorded beforehand?
