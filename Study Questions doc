1. Do children with DM present more frequently than their controls?

2. If so - when do they start to present more frequently

3. Hypothesis generating: How do they present i.e. what modes of presentation and what codes are recorded

4. Testing: Is there evidence that they present with classic symptoms (Polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, nocturia, enuresis...)
prior to diagnosis?  When do these codes become more prevalent in these children than controls?

5. What proportion of children with DM are referred by their GP, and of those who were not, did they have codes for consultations
+/- symptoms recorded beforehand?
